Shower Temperature Control

<h1>Shower Temperature Control</h1>

<p>
  This Python script allows the user to set a target temperature for their shower,
  adjust the initial temperature of the water, and specify the duration of the shower.
  During the shower, the script adjusts the temperature gradually to reach the target temperature.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Target Temperature:</strong> The temperature that the user wants to achieve during the shower.</li>
  <li><strong>Initial Temperature:</strong> The starting temperature of the water before the shower begins.</li>
  <li><strong>Shower Time:</strong> The duration of the shower in minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Temperature Adjustment:</strong> The script adjusts the temperature gradually based on the difference between the obtained temperature and the target temperature.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Possible Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>User Interface Enhancement:</strong> Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience, allowing users to input data through buttons and sliders.</li>
  <li><strong>Temperature Sensor Integration:</strong> Integrate temperature sensors to measure the actual water temperature and adjust it accordingly, providing more accurate control.</li>
  <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Implement error handling to handle invalid user inputs and unexpected errors gracefully, providing helpful error messages to the user.</li>
  <li><strong>Feedback Mechanism:</strong> Add a feedback mechanism to inform the user when the target temperature is reached or if there are any issues during the shower process.</li>
</ul>
